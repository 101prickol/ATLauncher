ATLauncher
====================================

### What is it?

ATLauncher is a Launcher for Minecraft which integrates multiple different ModPacks to allow you to download and install ModPacks easily and quickly.

### Things to Note

Please note that I (RyanTheAllmighty) have created this alone up until now and being a 1st year Computer Science student, my coding may not be the best, most accurate or efficient, so please keep that in mind.

Other than that, I am releasing this as an Open Source project in hopes that others may contribute to better our Launcher and because I think Open Source is a good thing.

### Coding Standards

Please keep all line lengths to 100 characters and use 4 spaces rather than tab characters
